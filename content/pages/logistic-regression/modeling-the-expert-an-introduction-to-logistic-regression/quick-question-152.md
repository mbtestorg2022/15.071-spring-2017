Quick Question
--------------

Suppose the coefficients of a logistic regression model with two independent variables are as follows:

\\( \\beta\_{()} = -1.5 , \\enspace \\beta\_1 = 3 , \\enspace \\beta\_2 = -0.5 \\)

And we have an observation with the following values for the independent variables:

\\( x\_1 = 1 , \\enspace x\_2 = 5 \\)

What is the value of the Logit for this observation? Recall that the Logit is log(Odds).

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

What is the value of the Odds for this observation? Note that you can compute e^x, for some number x, in your R console by typing exp(x). The function exp() computes the exponential of its argument.

Exercise 2

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

What is the value of P(y = 1) for this observation?

Exercise 3

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
