Quick Question
--------------

If a baseball team's OBP is 0.311 and SLG is 0.405, how many runs do we expect the team to score?

Using the linear regression model constructed during the lecture (the one that uses OBP and SLG as independent variables), enter the number of runs we expect the team to score:

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

If a baseball team's opponents OBP (OOBP) is 0.297 and oppenents SLG (OSLG) is 0.370, how many runs do we expect the team to allow?

Using the linear regression model discussed during the lecture (the one on the last slide of the previous video), enter the number of runs we expect the team to allow:

Exercise 2
