Quick Question
--------------

Suppose we had two more teams in our tournament (for a total of 6 teams). Each division would have 3 teams. So each team plays **two** teams twice (the teams in their division), and each team plays three teams once (the teams in the other division). This means that the tournament will last for 7 weeks. How many decision variables would we have?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

How many constraints would we have? Don't include the constraints that force the variables to be binary when counting the constraints here. (HINT: We would have 6 division constraints, since each pair in each division needs to play twice.)

Exercise 2
